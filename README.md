# WinXploy
This repository contains my personal deployment workflow for a debloated, optimized as well as clean Windows OS installation including third party software.

Basically it is just a simple PowerShell-Script (WinXploy.ps1) combining different scripts and automating the process.
The real hard work is done by all the great open source projects it makes use of, big thanks for sharing!

It is based on the PowerShell-Framework [OSDCloud](https://github.com/OSDeploy/OSDCloud) which is really a great work done by
[David Segura](https://github.com/OSDeploy) and many other people. Further more it includes the work of following projects:

- [Sophia Script](https://github.com/farag2/Sophia-Script-for-Windows)
- [Win11Debloat](https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat)
- [winscript](https://github.com/flick9000/winscript)
